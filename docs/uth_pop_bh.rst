Black Hole Populations
======================
In these examples, we will initialize a stellar population object, defined
by the minimum virial temperature of halos in which stars form, ``Tmin``, 
the star formation efficiency, ``fstar``, and other optional keyword arguments.

To begin, import ares and initialize an instance of the BlackHolePopulation class:

:: 

    import ares
    pop = ares.populations.BlackHolePopulation(Tmin=1e4, fstar=0.1)
    
Once initialized, there are several class methods available to compute the star-formation rate density (SFRD) and emissivity (in the UV and X-ray):
    
::

    z = 20.
    pop.AccretionRateDensity(z)          # [g / ccm**3 / s]
    pop.XrayLuminosityDensity(z)         # [erg / ccm**3 / s]
    pop.LymanWernerLuminosityDensity(z)  # [erg / ccm**3 / s]
    
Class methods always return values in cgs units, and when applicable, volume densities are assumed to be in comoving units (in the comments above, ccm stands for co-moving centimeters).

To convert to more recognizable units, use conversion factors from ``ares``:

::

    from ares.physics.Constants import rhodot_cgs
    pop.SFRD(z) * rhodot_cgs                              # [Msun / cMpc**3 / yr]
    pop.XrayLuminosityDensity(z) * cm_per_mpc**3          # [erg / cMpc**3 / s]
    
where Msun is solar masses, and cMpc is used to denote co-moving Megaparsecs.


Black hole models have a wider variety of behaviors available than stellar models.
