Code Structure
==============
*ARES* is organized hierarchically, with particularly heavy use of Python
`generators <https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators>`_. This makes for a code
whose behavior can be easily adapted during run-time. 

The top level submodule of `ares` is the :py:mod:`ares.simulations` submodule.
